# GETodac server


Getodac is a (very) simple & fast HTTP(s) server written, from scratch, in C++17 and boost (though it doesn't use boost's asio).
Because Getodac it's so simple it can easily handle a huge number of concurrent connections.

Getodac it's in beta stage and it doesn't have a stable API/ABI.
